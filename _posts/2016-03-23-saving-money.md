### Brew your own coffee at home

#### Potential Money Saved:
A typical chain restaurant coffee can set you back up to $3 a day. That same coffee can be brewed at home for just 20 cents. This switch could save you hundreds of dollars a year.

### Eat more rice, lentils and beans

#### Potential Money Saved:
Rice, lentils and beans are incredibly inexpensive and good for you. In addition, they pack a lot of fiber and in the case of beans and lentils, a lot of plant protein. Purchasing in bulk can reduce the price of each to under two dollars a pound.

### Wait one month before making any non-essential purchases

#### Potential Money Saved:
Impulse purchases can lead to wasting money on a lot of unnecessary items. To curb money spent on random gadgets, implement a 30 day waiting period for any purchases you make that aren't essential to living.

### Get books, dvds and magazines at your library

#### Potential Money Saved:
Your local library is filled with plenty of things for your entertainment all at no cost. So rather than spending $10 to $20 bucks on a dvd, see if its at your library first.

### Cut your cable and your home phone
